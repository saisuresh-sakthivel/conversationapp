## Conversation App

Web application to support customer service agents to address customer queries and contact them using the contact list.

## Technology used

Used [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/getting-started) UI theme for building the layout and components.

Used html [icons](https://symbl.cc/en/2709/) to add icon to contacts. The decision made to not use react-icons are any other library just to add one/two icons.
